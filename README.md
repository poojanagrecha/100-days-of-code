# About
The #100daysofcode challenge is a journey to gaining skills in the programming world! I have chosen to follow along with Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python course and will be uploading all progress to my [log](log.md). If you would like to follow me along this journey I will be posting almost daily updates on my Instagram: [@codewithpooja](instagram.com/codewithpooja) and on my [LinkedIn](linkedin.in/poojanagrecha)!
