# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I am starting from the very of basics of Python to brush up on my skills, today I created a Band Name generator where I used input functions to grab the name of your city and the name of your pet. The output will be the generated band name (your city + pet name).

### Day 2: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created a tip calculator that will take the input of your total bill, percentage you would like to tip, and amount of people it will be split between. This code emphasizes the use of math operators, data types, round function, and f strings.

### Day 3: February 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: For today's assignment I created a Love Calculator taking in two names (you + your crush) and formulating your Love Score! Additionaly for my project, I created a treasure island game using the combination of if/else statements, .lower() function, operators, and conditionals.

### Day 4: February 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a rock paper scissors game you can play with the computer. This project uses the random module, lists, indexing lists, nested lists, and nest if/else statements. I found this project quite difficult but learned a lot about nesting lists and if/else statements within your code.

### Day 5: February 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: In today's world, big sites storing your data are getting hacked and passwords are being breached to hackers. It is crucial to have a strong password, therefore today's project entailed a password generator. Using for loops, you will be asked to enter the amount of letters, symbols, and numbers you would like in your password and a computer generated password will be created.

### Day 6: February 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I tackled while loops using Reeborg's World. The final project was to help the Reeborg go through a maze using while loops and if/else statements for any given maze. Because this was done through reeborg.ca no code will be pushed.
