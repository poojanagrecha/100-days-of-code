# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I am starting from the very of basics of Python to brush up on my skills, today I created a Band Name generator where I used input functions to grab the name of your city and the name of your pet. The output will be the generated band name (your city + pet name).

### Day 2: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created a tip calculator that will take the input of your total bill, percentage you would like to tip, and amount of people it will be split between. This code emphasizes the use of math operators, data types, round function, and f strings.

### Day 3: February 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: For today's assignment I created a Love Calculator taking in two names (you + your crush) and formulating your Love Score! Additionaly for my project, I created a treasure island game using the combination of if/else statements, .lower() function, operators, and conditionals.

### Day 4: February 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a rock paper scissors game you can play with the computer. This project uses the random module, lists, indexing lists, nested lists, and nest if/else statements. I found this project quite difficult but learned a lot about nesting lists and if/else statements within your code.

### Day 5: February 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: In today's world, big sites storing your data are getting hacked and passwords are being breached to hackers. It is crucial to have a strong password, therefore today's project entailed a password generator. Using for loops, you will be asked to enter the amount of letters, symbols, and numbers you would like in your password and a computer generated password will be created.

### Day 6: February 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I tackled while loops using Reeborg's World. The final project was to help the Reeborg go through a maze using while loops and if/else statements for any given maze. Because this was done through reeborg.ca no code will be pushed.

### Day 7: February 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a hangman game that allows a user to pick letters to form a word. If the letter is not in the word, the hang man will have limbs attach until the full body has been drawn out and the game is over.

### Day 8: February 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Caesar Cipher, an encryption program that allows a user to input a word, choose how many letters to shift it and outcomes a new word. You can then take the new word and decode it!

### Day 9: February 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I made a blind auction program that allows a user to input their name and bidding price. The program will ask if a user would like to add another person and if selected "Yes", the screen will clear for another user to input their name and bidding price (This is done to keep the auction silent!) After everyone has entered the bid, the program will determine the winner by highest bid. This program emphasizes the use of dictionaries, lists, and nesting dictionaries with lists and vice versa. 

<em>Note: The clear function only works on repl.it, so to try this code out I have provided the repl.it link.</em>

### Day 10: February 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a python calculator program.
