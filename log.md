# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I am starting from the very of basics of Python to brush up on my skills, today I created a Band Name generator where I used input functions to grab the name of your city and the name of your pet. The output will be the generated band name (your city + pet name).

### Day 2: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created a tip calculator that will take the input of your total bill, percentage you would like to tip, and amount of people it will be split between. This code emphasizes the use of math operators, data types, round function, and f strings.
